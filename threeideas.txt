I’d like to do a video project on various places I like, so here are my 3 ideas!

1. Libraries (both in-person and virtual spaces): I really missed going to libraries during quarantine, and I even made a virtual library on zoom for some Princeton students. I might recreate some of Princeton’s physical libraries online and then film the physical vs. virtual library side-by-side

2. My favorite places on campus: As a senior, I’m trying to remember and explore campus while I can. I want to pick my 5 favorite spots and make a video of each location, adding a VoiceOver of a journal entry or an interview taking one friend to each of the places

3. Grocery stores: may be boring for some, but I absolutely love grocery shopping. The product placement, layout, and interior of each grocery store carries so much purpose and thought, so I want to explore more of that.
